## Organizing a portal project with modular architecture can be achieved by following these steps:

1. **Identify the modules**: As you have mentioned, modules like customer service and fraud report should be identified, along with any other required modules. Each module should be self-contained with clear boundaries between them.

2. **Determine the dependencies**: Once the modules are identified, determine the dependencies between them. A dependency diagram should be created to understand how the modules interact with each other.

3. **Design the architecture**: Based on the modules and their dependencies, design the architecture of the portal. The architecture should be modular, with each module having its own code base. This allows for easy maintenance and upgrades to individual modules.

4. [**Implement the modules**](./IntegratingModules.md): Each module should be implemented separately, with its own code base. The code for each module should be versioned separately, allowing for deployments to only require a new version of that module.

5. **Integrate the modules**: Once the modules are implemented, they should be integrated together. This should be done in a way that ensures that each module is self-contained and does not depend on other modules.

6. **Test and deploy**: The portal should be thoroughly tested to ensure that each module is functioning as expected. Once testing is complete, each module can be deployed separately, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

By following these steps, a modular architecture can be implemented for a portal project, with each module having its own code base and deployments only requiring a new version of that module.
